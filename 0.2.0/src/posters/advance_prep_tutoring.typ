/// lists

`fruits = ["apples", "bananas", "pears"]`

this list has 3 items.
let's add strawberries.

`fruits.append("strawberries")`

and now the fruits list has 4 items. 

/// show the fruits list

actually, instead of strawberries, blueberries. we'll have to remove
the strawberrriies, and then add blueberries.

#commentary(
    `fruits.pop(-1)`, [remove the last item]
    `fruits.append(blueberries)`, [add a new item]
)

/// show the fruits list



fruits.pop(-1) means pop the last item in the list. how would you pop the second
to last item?




/// questions about pop() and append(). creative and tricky


addition

`a = 3, b = 4, a + b = 7`

lists can be added too.


`fruits = , meats = , fruits + meats = `

one of the most important things to add is letters.


`apple = "too", pie = "yummy"`

what does apple + pie equal?
